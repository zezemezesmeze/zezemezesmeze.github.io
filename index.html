<h1>Adaeze Uwazie </h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Adaeze Uwazie and I am a Senior computer science student from Chicago, Illinois. I trasnfered to NCAT in 2022 and I have since loved it since. I am also a really big anime lover and manga reader! This love for the 2 has brought me very far and has allowed me to become the current president of the Anime Aggies! I am very excited to see what is to come from this year.</p>
